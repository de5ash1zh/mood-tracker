### 1. **Setting Up the Project**
- Create three files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- The `index.html` will contain the structure of the application, including the form to log moods and buttons to switch between different views.
- The `style.css` will have minimal styling to keep the focus on functionality.
- The `script.js` will handle the logic of the app.

### 2. **Building the HTML Structure**
- A simple form with buttons or radio inputs to select mood emojis (Happy, Sad, Neutral, Excited, etc.).
- Buttons to view logs in different formats (Day, Week, Month, Calendar).
- A container to display mood logs and the calendar view.

### 3. **Handling Mood Logging**
- When a user selects a mood and submits it, the mood along with the current date is saved as an object in an array.
- This array is then stored in the browser's `LocalStorage` so that the data persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.

### 4. **Displaying Moods**
- The stored mood data is retrieved from `LocalStorage` when the app loads.
- Different views are created:
  - **Day View:** Shows the mood logged for the current day.
  - **Week View:** Shows moods logged in the last 7 days.
  - **Month View:** Shows all moods logged in the current month.
  - **Calendar View:** A grid-like layout where each cell represents a day of the month. If a mood is logged for that day, it is displayed in the corresponding cell.

### 5. **Switching Views**
- Using event listeners, users can switch between the views by clicking on buttons.
- The displayed data changes based on the view selected.

### 6. **Saving and Retrieving Data**
- Data is saved in `LocalStorage` in the form of a stringified array of objects.
- Each object has the format:
  ```javascript
  { date: "YYYY-MM-DD", mood: "Happy" }
  ```
- When the app is loaded, the data is parsed and displayed accordingly.

### 7. **Rendering Calendar View**
- A simple grid structure is created using JavaScript where days of the current month are displayed in a tabular format.
- If a mood exists for a particular day, it is displayed within that cell.

### 8. **Updating and Deleting Data**
- Users can log a new mood for a day, and if it already exists, the previous mood is overwritten.
- Deleting a mood log can be added later as an enhancement.
